# Structure

This project template aims to be as clear as possible with minimal root noise.

## ./artifacts

Generated upon building, this folder contains everything created by the project. Deleting this folder leaves the project in a clean state.

## Directory.Build.props

Contains common build properties and dependencies shared among all child projects/folders.

## .editorconfig

Contains rules for all child projects/folders. Instances under src & tests generally contain analyzer settings.
